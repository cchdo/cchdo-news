# CCHDO News

## How to Update
* Create a pull request that adds a new markdown news file in /news (just copy an earlier file and then edit the contents)
* Name this file using a YYYY-mm-dd-some_title.md convention
* Edit the title and date front matter to be accurate
* Write your content in markdown, make sure all links are absolute and do not include the full domain
  * e.g. /cruise/awesome instead of https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/cruise/awesome
* On pull request creation, wait for the build preview to generate from cloudflare, check this preview is what you want. Cloudflare will put a link under the pull request.
* Merge, in a few minutes the changes will be live on the CCHDO homepage
