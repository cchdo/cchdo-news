title: Search Functionality Update
date: "2024-12-11"

Our search functionality now supports field-specific queries, allowing you to refine your search using the syntax `field:"term"`.

For example, try [`ship:"Atlantis"`][1] or [`woce_line:"P15"`][2] to find exactly what you need!

Please see our [Advanced Search][3] for more information.
