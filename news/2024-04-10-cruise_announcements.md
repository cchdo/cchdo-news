Congratulations to the US GO-SHIP program for the successful completion of the I08S and A13.5 sections.

This was the third attempt at an occupation of A13.5, which was disturbed by COVID-19. 'The third time's the charm' for the A13.5 cruise, applause all around!

In the final report from I08S, chief scientist Sebastien Bigorre notes "The I08S cruise will end tomorrow, but its scientific and human legacy will endure." A beautiful and true sentiment that we couldn't agree with more.

All those contributing to both cruises, and the program at large, have much to celebrate and to be proud of. Cheers!
