We’ve made updates to our [Submission Page](/submit) to improve the submission process:

- **Updated Submission Guidelines**: Please see our [updated Submission Guidelines](https://learning.cchdo.io/submitting_data/quick_guide) for best practices and file templates.
- **New Submission Validator**: A new validation tool is now available on the [Submission Page](/submit) to help you check your files for proper formatting and common errors before submitting.

Files that meet the submission guidelines and pass all checks will be processed faster, but we’ll continue to accept all data.
